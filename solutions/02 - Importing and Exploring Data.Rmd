## Importing COVID19 data from a CSV file

Take a look at the *Files* pane on the bottom right. Note that there is a file named *covid_testing.csv*. The objective of this exercise is to *import* that CSV file into R as a data frame, and then take a first look at its contents using the *Data Viewer*.

Recall that to import CSV files, we use the *read_csv()* function, which is part of the *tidyverse* package. The *read_csv()* function takes a *filename* as an argument and returns a *data frame*. To capture the data frame in a named object, we use the *assignment operator* ( <- ).

In the following code chunk, we first load the *tidyverse* package and then use the *read_csv()* function to load the *covid_testing.csv* file and capture it in an object named *covid_testing*. 

Run the following code chunk.


```{r, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
covid_testing <- read_csv("covid_testing.csv")
```

Hint: click on the green triangle in the upper right corner of the code chunk!


## Inspecting a data frame

One thing that Excel does well is to provide an interactive visual representation of the data. This allows you to inspect it by sorting and filtering. RStudio actually does this well, too, with one difference - it won't let you *change* any of the data while you inspect it.

Look on the right at the *Environment* pane (you might have to click on the "Environment" tab) and find the entry *covid_testing*. This is the data frame you just created inside of R's memory. (If you don't see covid_testing, try running the code chunk above again).

On the far right next to *covid_testing*, you will spot a symbol that looks like a small table. Click on it to make the *Data Viewer* appear.

Without writing any code, just by working with the Data Viewer, try to answer the following questions:

  1. How many rows are in the data frame? How many columns?
  
  There are 15,524 rows and 17 columns. This information can be seen at the bottom of the Data Viewer, and also in the Environment pane. Note that in R parlance, rows == observations, and columns == variables.
  
  2. Go ahead and try to edit one of the values in this viewer. You will find that you can't. It would have been easy for the RStudio programmers to allow editing of specific values, but they decided not to add that feature. Why do you think this was designed that way?

  This would encourage point-and-click workflows that are not reproducible.

  3. Each row in *covid_testing* represents a single COVID19 test. The value in the *pan_day* column indicates the day (after the start of the pandemic) on which the test sample was taken. On which "pandemic day" was the first test sample taken? The last?

  If sort the table by `pan_day` and then look at the very top and the very bottom, you will find out the first "pandemic day" was 4, and the last one was 107. You can sort the data in the Data Viewer by clicking on the column header.
  
  Important: this doesn't actually change the data in the `covid_testing` data frame! 

  4. How many tests overall were positive? How many positive tests were there in the first 30 days of the pandemic? (Hint: look at the Filter button)
  
  The `result` column holds that information. We can apply a filter to that column to only show us rows where the value in the `result` column is "positive". Click on Filter and enter "positive" in the text field that appears below the `result` header. You will now see that the bottom line of the data viewer reads "Showing 1 to [some number] of 865 entries, 17 total columns (filtered from 15,524 total entries)". So there were 865 positive tests, out of 15,524 total.

When you are done, don't forget to click "yes" or give us a "thumbs up" in the Participants window in Zoom!
