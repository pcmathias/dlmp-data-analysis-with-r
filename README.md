# DLMP Data Analysis with R Lessons

## Welcome!

These R lessons aim to teach participants with minimal programming experience the basics of the R statistical programming language for reproducible laboratory data analytics. R is a freely available programming environment that is aimed at common activities in data analysis including complex data manipulation, statistical analysis, automation, and publication-quality data visualization. We will introduce basic concepts of R programming as well as more generalizable best practices in working with laboratory data. 
  
## Before your first lesson

For the best experience, please have the following ready before the workshop begins:

- Install the latest version of [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) as some [older browsers](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/227449447-Supported-browsers-for-RStudio-Connect) may not be compatible with the RStudio application.
- Please complete the following survey so we can better understand your R experience and what you want out of the course: [DLMP R Pre-Lesson Survey](https://forms.gle/2gMtVHCjJKUfpjEp7).
- We will provide instructions on how to sign into our departmental instance of RStudio Server when we start.

## Accessing/interacting with the course content

The content is available at our [github page](https://github.com/pcmathias/dlmp-data-analysis-with-r). In preparation for each lesson we will download the exercise file we need and then transfer it to our RStudio Server to work with.

## Using the DLMP instance of RStudio Server

For clinical users in DLMP (e.g. staff, faculty, and trainees working with clinical data), we provide access to an instance of RStudio Server that you can sign into and perform your work on a scientific server securely. We will share more info about this instance to eligible users.

## Installing RStudio onto your own computer

We will be utilizing our cloud based RStudio instance in the workshop. You may want to install R and RStudio installed **on your own computer** in order to work on projects (though using the department-provided instance would be preferred, especially if you are working with protected health information). You can find step by step instructions for installing these on macOS ([here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM88tYlEy_g)) or Windows ([here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRKmZK5-6aE)). At each step, select the most recent version of R and RStudio available for your operating system (it may not match the versions installed in the videos but the steps will be the same). Please be cognizant of how you manage sensitive data on your desktop or laptop.

## Acknowledgments

All of the course instructors have previous experience implementing and executing R workshops at a variety of venues. The workshop we are presenting for the API community is in many ways a product of these past experiences.
