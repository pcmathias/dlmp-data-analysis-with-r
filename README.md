# DLMP Data Analysis with R Lessons

## Welcome!

These R lessons aim to teach participants with minimal programming experience the basics of the R statistical programming language for reproducible laboratory data analytics. R is a freely available programming environment that is aimed at common activities in data analysis including complex data manipulation, statistical analysis, automation, and publication-quality data visualization. We will introduce basic concepts of R programming as well as more generalizable best practices in working with laboratory data.

## Before you arrive

For the best experience, please have the following ready before the workshop begins:

- Please sign up for a free RStudio Cloud account  [here](https://rstudio.cloud/). You can sign up/link to the Google account linked to your UW email if you do not want to create a separate username and password.
- Install the latest version of [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) as some [older browsers](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/227449447-Supported-browsers-for-RStudio-Connect) may not be compatible with the RStudio application).
- Please complete the following survey so we can better understand your R experience and what you want out of the course: [DLMP R Pre-Lesson Survey](https://forms.gle/dbHFmNYaXSLup2Ni9).

## Accessing/interacting with the course content

1. Course content will be pre-loaded into the RStudio Cloud instance, so we will cover how to access it at the beginning of the course
2. The content is available at our [github page](https://github.com/pcmathias/dlmp-data-analysis-with-r) and can be downloaded from there as well.
3. If you have a tablet you may find it useful to bring and use that to act as a second screen: you work on your laptop to complete exercises and use your tablet to review the lesson slides that were just covered.
4. This will be a virtual course. Please type questions into the Zoom chat and the instructor and/or a teaching assistant will answer in the chat or open a discussion with the group.

## Installing RStudio onto your own computer

We will be utilizing our cloud based RStudio instance in the workshop. However, _in the long term_, you will need R and RStudio installed **on your own computer** in order to work on private data. You can find step by step instructions for installing these on macOS ([here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM88tYlEy_g)) or Windows ([here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRKmZK5-6aE)).

## Acknowledgments

All of the course instructors have previous experience implementing and executing R workshops at a variety of venues. The workshop we are presenting for the API community is in many ways a product of these past experiences.
