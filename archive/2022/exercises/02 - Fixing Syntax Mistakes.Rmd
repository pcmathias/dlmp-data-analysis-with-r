I’ve written some code to create a sequence from 0 to 500 in increments of 25 called sequence_of_25s.  Ultimately I want to calculate the median value of this sequence.  Unfortunately I’ve made some mistakes in my code and I am hoping you can help me find them.


```{r}

sequence_of_25s -< seq(from=0 to=50, by=25)

```

```{r}

median(sequence of_25s]

```
